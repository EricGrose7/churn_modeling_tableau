# Churn Modeling with Tableau
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard for analyzing customer churn in a hypothetical subscription-based business. The dashboard is based on a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a customer churning.

**Dataset**   <br>
The dataset used in this project is a hypothetical dataset containing information about customers in a subscription-based business. The dataset contains information such as customer demographics, subscription details, and usage information. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set, with the training set used to train the machine learning model and the test set used to evaluate the performance of the model.

**Machine Learning Model**   <br>
The machine learning model used in this project is a binary classification model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn or not. The model is trained on the training set using several classification algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. The performance of the model is evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Tableau Dashboard**   <br>
The Tableau dashboard in this project is designed to help business users analyze customer churn and take proactive steps to retain customers. The dashboard contains several visualizations, including:

- A customer churn summary, showing the total number of customers and the percentage of customers who churned
- A customer demographics breakdown, showing the distribution of customers by gender, age, and location
- A subscription details breakdown, showing the distribution of customers by subscription type and subscription plan
- A usage details breakdown, showing the distribution of customers by their usage of the service

The dashboard also includes a page for exploring the machine learning model, allowing users to input customer information and see the predicted probability of the customer churning.

**Conclusion**   <br>
This Tableau dashboard provides a powerful tool for analyzing customer churn and taking proactive steps to retain customers. The dashboard is based on a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a customer churning, and includes several visualizations to help business users understand the factors that contribute to churn. The dashboard also includes an interactive page for exploring the machine learning model, allowing users to input customer information and see the predicted probability of the customer churning.
